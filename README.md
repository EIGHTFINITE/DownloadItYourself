# Modpack Updater

Keeps a set of files up to date. Currently set up to keep track of a small Vanilla+ Minecraft modpack but can be used to keep track of any online resource.

Simply fork the project, change `downloadlist.json` to fit your needs, maybe add a few download drivers, and be on your way.
